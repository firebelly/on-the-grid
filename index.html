          <p class="description">
            A long abandoned and neglected stretch of elevated freight train tracks cutting east-west through Northwest Chicago, what used to only be accessible by a few muddy hillside entryways is now transformed into a bustling, paved, well-lit thoroughfare. Nearly three miles of biking, jogging, and elevated ogling opportunity thanks to a hefty $50 million grant form the federal government, meant to reduce traffic and improve air quality. For years the Bloomingdale Line was a hideaway for drinking teens, taggers, homeless folks, and the occasional adventurous jogger or cross-country skier, but it's now heralded as Chicago's answer to New York's similar project, the High Line.

            A divey neighborhood fav, tucked among quiet residential streets. Dog-friendly, so there is often a gaggle of canine regulars alongside the beardos. Board games, free pool, good jukebox, a comfortably dim interior, reasonably priced beers with monthly specials = A-OK BAR TIMES.

            Iron Chef & Top Chef have featured many Chicagoans, thus creating internationally known personalities. But who is it that these folks look to for inspiration or for their own lunch? Your favorite chef’s favorite chef: Bill Kim. His culinary approach is fusion, in the style of Picasso towards cubism—highly trained, expertly skilled, creativity with intent and articulation. Fifteen years in the top French and Asian restaurants across the country, Bill's training and discipline comes directly from the likes of Chef Jean Banchet and Charlie Trotter. One of three restaurants Bill owns and is executive chef of, Belly Shack is defined by metaphor of the chef's life. Born in Seoul, South Korea, Chef Bill made his Humboldt Park (predominantly Puerto Rican neighborhood) location a moment for his past to meet his present. Here he unites Korean with Puerto Rican street food and sandwiches through the highest caliber of ingredients. <br>
            <br>
            Chicago can be summed up as a mixed bag of outspoken dreamers, busting their ass to build something to call thier own. Often this melting pot finds success by bringing together familiar with exotic. Belly Shack’s Hot Dog is a prime example: all beef hot dog topped with egg noodles, a kimchi pickled green papaya salsa, served within a thick slice of brioche with togarashi spiced fries on the side.

            Although it feels like a showroom labeled "Ye Olde Route 66 Knick-knack Decorated Bar Place"—the delicious homemade-tortilla tacos, good daily specials, and low prices more than make up for the strangely generic decor. Also surprisingly tasty (& large!) salads, and a daily get-drunk-cheap-fast "No Bullshit!" special of $6 for taco + cheapo tallboy o' beer + shot of Evan Williams.

            Tucked away from the California and Augusta intersection, CC Ferns is a one of those hidden gems people only dream of coming across. Weekday or weekend, my day begins here. Cortado, expresso, iced-coffee, each uses Ferns' custom roast from Metropolis Coffee Company. The roast is called “Project X” and it's needfully strong with a cocoa and earth forward flavor that foregoes acidity or bitterness. While the café opened in 2015, it physically shares backrooms as well as ownership with a dimly-lit bar that’s been open since 1937. This detail allows the liquor license to be shared across spaces, making CC Ferns a must for Sunday mornings. The adorably named Boozy Steamers is a unique offering in Chicago, as no other café serves booze. Worry not, with a name like that, no one will be upset that you got started before they answered their first email of the day.<br>
            <br>
            If you are passing through before billable time, grab a doughnut and iced coffee. But if you are nearby and not about to work or drive, order the Scotch & Honey—it’s made with Famous Grouse, almond and honey, and it will give you a buzz.

            Charming as heck and tasty too. It’s BYO and cash-only, which doesn’t stop the hungry masses from packing the place on the weekend. Service can be a little slow, but bring a pal you don’t mind talking to and enjoy the ambient whimsy. The biscuits alone are worth the wait.

            Haywood Tavern talks up its neighborhood feel, but with a menu boasting excellent craft beer, fancy cocktails and seasonal small plates, this clearly isn’t your abuela’s Humboldt Park. Gentrification real talk aside, this is a perfect date spot—the food and drinks are crazy good, the service is friendly and the atmosphere is cozy. And if all that’s not enough, the kitchen’s open until 1am, so if you’re looking to satisfy your inner caveman with a late night steak tartar, Haywood’s the place to go.

            Equally stunning and decrepit, the 1928-built Field House misses the days when boats emerged from its bowels. Inside is full of great decorative stonework and marble pillars, but despite $1.7 million of repairs in the last few years, it still feels like a neglected post-apocalyptic set piece.

            Who doesn’t love the sour sweet stench of too much chlorine in the summer? Cheap as free and clean to boot, the Humboldt Park Pool is a seasonal mecca for humans of all sizes, complete with giant water slide that’s just as fun as it looks. The lifeguards are on high alert, so don’t even think about running. BYOSPF.

            Hardcore heavymetal burger joint. Albeit very tasty, it's notoriously loud as hell, and the hell-yes-yum-to-dollar-dollar-bill factor is high—think $13 for basic up to $18 for "The Death Sentence Burger." Tuesdays are half price burger day, but expect a long wait. Mac and cheese is worth traveling for.

            Sure they have sammies and burgers and things, but why bother? The homemade ice cream is the main event here, though they also make dang good candies too. You can’t really go wrong, the only tough part is making a decision (or getting a table come summer). If you have 14 friends, take ‘em all and order the World’s Largest Terrapin: 15 scoops of fresh french vanilla topped with pretty much everything. “A delight to share.”

            Outsider art, mystical treasures, curious specimen and oddities from the far corners of the globe. Tarot card readings too! This little gem of a shop also hosts regular gatherings celebrating the weird, the wild and the decidedly untraditional. Open minds and hearts only, no bad vibes allowed.

            The American dream is alive and well, although it is seasonal. Open only throughout the summer months, Tastee Freez is the neighborhood respite serving the coolest treats on the hottest days. This is not a revised contemporary interpretation of a classic with a pseudo-sexy geometric logo that emphasis hexagons and icons of everything imagineable. Here we have the pater familias—dipped cones or frozen bananas, a mix-match of ultra-vernacular lettering, ample hopscotch space near the picnic-table seating, and both dairy and ice-based treats with every topping, flavor or combination you could ever come up with at a moment's notice. The line can be long, the neighborhood can be rough… order quick. If you are looking for a truly delightable moment, order a Snow Storm (blue-razpberry), it’s not on the menu and thus communicates your expertum of this popsicle stand.
