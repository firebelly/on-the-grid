            A long abandoned and neglected stretch of elevated freight train tracks cutting east-west through Northwest Chicago, what used to only be accessible by a few muddy hillside entryways is now transformed into a bustling, paved, well-lit thoroughfare. Nearly three miles of biking, jogging, and elevated ogling opportunity thanks to a hefty $50 million grant form the federal government, meant to reduce traffic and improve air quality. For years the Bloomingdale Line was a hideaway for drinking teens, taggers, homeless folks, and the occasional adventurous jogger or cross-country skier, but it's now heralded as Chicago's answer to New York's similar project, the High Line.

            Tony will hook you up. Ferns, hostas, coleus, lemongrass, tomatoes, soil, manure, gloves, whatever you need. Gardenias? Fertilizer? Money tree? Fresh flowers? All here. A busy, dense little nursery, chock-a-block with healthy flora, family run since '93.

            A divey neighborhood fav, tucked among quiet residential streets. Dog-friendly, so there is often a gaggle of canine regulars alongside the beardos. Board games, free pool, good jukebox, a comfortably dim interior, reasonably priced beers with monthly specials = A-OK BAR TIMES.

            Although it feels like a showroom labeled "Ye Olde Route 66 Knick-knack Decorated Bar Place"—the delicious homemade-tortilla tacos, good daily specials, and low prices more than make up for the strangely generic decor. Also surprisingly tasty (& large!) salads, and a daily get-drunk-cheap-fast "No Bullshit!" special of $6 for taco + cheapo tallboy o' beer + shot of Evan Williams.

            "Is that everything, honey?" Prepare your mouth for buttery sandwich heaven. Tripleta and medianoche and lechon for the meat lovers, egg and avocado for the vegheads. Wash down a tasty quesito with a sweetbomb namesake cafe calao. Notoriously slow, but worth the wait.

          <span class="tag">parks</span> <span class="tag">fitness</span>
          <p class="description">
            Equally stunning and decrepit, the 1928-built Field House misses the days when boats emerged from its bowels. Inside is full of great decorative stonework and marble pillars, but despite $1.7 million of repairs in the last few years, it still feels like a neglected post-apocalyptic set piece.

            Get a copy of your key made while you travel back in time to a land where dusty forgotten tools and hinges and screws and hoses and hatchets are jammed into every crevice. It's your granddad's closet of curios fighting your grandpappy's filthy garage! Peek in the back room to see the oldest workbench known to man! Mighty weird and mighty friendly.

            Hardcore heavymetal burger joint. Albeit very tasty, it's notoriously loud as hell, and the hell-yes-yum-to-dollar-dollar-bill factor is high—think $13 for basic up to $18 for "The Death Sentence Burger." Tuesdays are half price burger day, but expect a long wait. Mac and cheese is worth traveling for.

            Do you love garlic? Of course you love garlic. Papa's will deliver it in spades on Chicago's fine contribution to latino cuisine: the jibarito. Imagine your sandwich bread turned into greasy fried plantains, smothered in mayonnaise and jammed with garlicky meat! Mouth pow! Also, perfect rotisserie chicken. Luis Guzmán ate here and his picture's on the wall and that's all you need to know.

            Originally a food truck, now also a Sick Fisher-decorated eatery tucked in the budding California street. Simple menu with oh-so-tasty veggie & meat pierogis, a polish sausage sandwich, pickled beet salad and pretzels. Sunny, open space with beautiful rough-hewn recycled lumber from Rebuilding Exchange.

          <p class="description">
            Over 800 varieties of craft beers are jammed into this tiny sliver of a shotgun bodega, alongside spirits, wine, general consumables, weekly homemade salsa that never disappoints, and a year-round selection of magically-always-perfectly-ripe avocados. Store owner Junior will charm your pants off regaling you with stories about hot peppers, obscure beer varietals, and how best to cook that zucchini on the grill.

            Everybody's favorite colossal rotting pavement hole! Drop in a quarter for good luck, an old shoe for kicks, or just deposit your entire fastfood bag—there's plenty of room for any old thing you want to disappear.
