            Tony will hook you up. Ferns, hostas, coleus, lemongrass, tomatoes, soil, manure, gloves, whatever you need. Gardenias? Fertilizer? Money tree? Fresh flowers? All here. A busy, dense little nursery, chock-a-block with healthy flora, family run since '93.

            A divey neighborhood fav, tucked among quiet residential streets. Dog-friendly, so there is often a gaggle of canine regulars alongside the beardos. Board games, free pool, good jukebox, a comfortably dim interior, reasonably priced beers with monthly specials = A-OK BAR TIMES.

            Although it feels like a showroom labeled "Ye Olde Route 66 Knick-knack Decorated Bar Place"—the delicious homemade-tortilla tacos, good daily specials, and low prices more than make up for the strangely generic decor. Also surprisingly tasty (& large!) salads, and a daily get-drunk-cheap-fast "No Bullshit!" special of $6 for taco + cheapo tallboy o' beer + shot of Evan Williams.

            "Is that everything, honey?" Prepare your mouth for buttery sandwich heaven. Tripleta and medianoche and lechon for the meat lovers, egg and avocado for the vegheads. Wash down a tasty quesito with a sweetbomb namesake cafe calao. Notoriously slow, but worth the wait.

            Equally stunning and decrepit, the 1928-built Field House misses the days when boats emerged from its bowels. Inside is full of great decorative stonework and marble pillars, but despite $1.7 million of repairs in the last few years, it still feels like a neglected post-apocalyptic set piece.

            Where Grand meets Chicago resides the tastiest tacos in Humboldt Park, served from a narrow triangular building that's chockablock with photos of Mexican revolutionaries donning powerful mustaches. Of note are the steak burrito and torta al pastor.

            Originally a food truck, now also a Sick Fisher-decorated eatery tucked in the budding California street. Simple menu with oh-so-tasty veggie & meat pierogis, a polish sausage sandwich, pickled beet salad and pretzels. Sunny, open space with beautiful rough-hewn recycled lumber from Rebuilding Center.

            Over 800 varieties of craft beers are jammed into this tiny sliver of a shotgun bodega, alongside spirits, wine, general consumables, weekly homemade salsa that never disappoints, and a year-round selection of magically-always-perfectly-ripe avocados. Store owner Junior will charm your pants off regaling you with stories about hot peppers, obscure beer varietals, and how best to cook that zucchini on the grill.

            Everybody's favorite colossal rotting pavement hole! Drop in a quarter for good luck, an old shoe for kicks, or just deposit your entire fastfood bag—there's plenty of room for any old thing you want to disappear. Handy for losing your handgun while running from the cops.
